The goal was to have some simple source code in C for vdroop control
proposed for the Voltage Source Converters (VSC). VSC is a simple
and basic control mechanism for load sharing in small grids. There
is lots of related work simulations etc. Next step is to implement
and study a small operational grid.

Read source code,  view references, try "make run"

You should see a simple plot of two terminals.

It's work-in-progress...
